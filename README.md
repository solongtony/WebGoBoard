# Web Go Board

An HTML5 based implementation of the game Go (also called igo, weiqi or wéiqí), using SVG and the Raphael library.  This is currently not a functional game, no game logic is implemented yet.  In the future I plan on supporting a traditional game format where stones are played on the intersection of board lines, and an `analog` version where stones can be played anywhere on the board.  Currently only the analog verion is in place, I will support the traditional style with a mode that forces stones to snap to the grid.

Currently works in Chrome, not in Firefox.  Don't know about IE.
